# Vanilla Javascript Pomodoro App

<br>

_This Pomodoro app was created with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and the Quotable REST API._

## Summary

I decided to build this app to sharpen my JS skills and because it is something I would use on a daily basis. 
I have used many Pomodor apps, but most lack features I wanted. Many show advertisements, lack features
I desired, cost money, or a combination of these things. So, why not build a great app that has everything 
I need and only costs a little sweat equity!?
