# Vanilla Javascript Pomodoro App

<br>

_This Pomodoro app was created with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, SASS, uses local storage for timer counts and the Quotable REST API for inspirational quotes after each cycle completes._

## Summary

I decided to build this app to sharpen my JS skills and because it is something I would use on a daily basis. 
I have used many Pomodor apps, but most lack features I wanted. Many show advertisements, lack features
I desired, cost money, or a combination of these things. So, why not build a great app that has everything 
I need and only costs a little sweat equity!? 

I used vanilla JS, SASS, Bootstrap, and a REST API for pulling inspirational quotes after every timer ends. The
application also stores completed timer counts in local storage and can be manually cleared by the user if desired.
